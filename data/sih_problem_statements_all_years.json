          "description": "Background The Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions. Description Breed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes. To address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration. Expected Solution • Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images. • Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds, lighting conditions, and varying animal poses. • Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses). • Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA. • Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries. • Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.",

          "description": "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes. Description: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes. Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis. There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs. Expected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can: Use images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification. Extract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques. Generate objective and consistent classification scores. Auto-record and store the classification data in a structured format. Provide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation. Be user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.",

          "description": "Background Indian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure. Detailed Description Currently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions—whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted—based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient. The network is constrained by finite infrastructure—limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities—shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable. Within a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness. Expected Solution An intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should: • Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically. • Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather). • Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations. • Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities. • Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs. • Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement.",

          "description": "Background In Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems, Rasa (taste) is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency. In the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products. Recent advances in sensor science and analytical technologies provide innovative solutions to these challenges. Electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such as Near-Infrared (NIR), Raman, and UV-Visible spectroscopy offer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples. When integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)—such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition—large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision. This AI-enabled, sensor-integrated approach ensures faster, objective, and cost-effective quality assurance, bridging traditional Ayurvedic principles with modern scientific validation. Detailed Description The problem statement aims to design and develop a sensor-integrated AI-enabled device for objective quality assessment of marketed herbal samples. The device will incorporate: • A multi-sensor e-tongue array to detect basic taste modalities (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent). • A threshold detection module for quantifying the minimum perceptible concentration of each taste-related compound. • Analytical integration with phytochemical profiling techniques (e.g., HPTLC, FTIR, LC-MS) for correlating taste signatures with chemical constituents. Expected Solution • A portable hardware prototype incorporating an electronic tongue (e-tongue) sensor array. • Calibration using authenticated herb samples and machine learning models trained on large datasets of taste and phytochemical fingerprints. • Smart alerts and decision support for detecting adulteration or substandard quality. • A centralized or cloud-compatible database that updates continuously with new samples and learning outputs. • Applicability across industries including Ayurvedic pharmacopeia standardization, herbal industry quality control, academic research, and regulatory bodies.",

          "description": "Background India’s Ayush sector is rapidly transitioning from paper-based records to interoperable digital health systems. Central to this transformation are two key coding systems: the National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMASTE) codes, which provide over 4,500 standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani disorders, WHO Standardised International Terminologies for Ayurveda and the WHO’s ICD-11, Chapter – 26, Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2), which integrates 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes into the global ICD framework. Harmonising these vocabularies within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms not only enables accurate clinical documentation and decision support but also ensures compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards—mandating FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT and LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and robust audit trails for consent and versioning. To operationalize this dual-coding approach, EMR vendors must implement a lightweight terminology micro-service that ingests NAMASTE CSV and synchronises with the WHO-11 ICD-API (Including Biomedicine and TM2). Within the EMR user interface, diagnosis entries should support auto-complete widgets that return both NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) codes, comply with the Coding rules of ICD-11 framework and store them together in the patient’s Problem List resource. This integration empowers clinicians to combine traditional and biomedical insights, facilitates Ayush insurance claims under global ICD-11 coding rules, and provides the Ministry of Ayush with real-time morbidity analytics aligned with national and international reporting standards. Description Design and prototype an API integration that brings India’s NAMASTE terminologies, WHO Standardised International terminology and the WHO ICD-11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) & Biomedicine) into a FHIR-compliant Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Your goal is to enable clinicians to record traditional medicine diagnoses (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) using NAMASTE codes, then automatically map them to global ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) identifiers—supporting dual/double-coding (One code denoting Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani (TM) and another denoting Biomedicine) for interoperability, analytics and insurance claims. Your deliverable is a lightweight micro-service or FHIR terminology plugin offering: • A FHIR compliant resource for NAMASTE codes linking to WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) and compliant with ICD-11 Coding rules. • A REST endpoint for auto-complete value-set lookup. • A translation operation converting NAMASTE ↔ TM2 codes. • An encounter upload endpoint that ingests FHIR Bundles with both code systems. • OAuth 2.0–secured access using ABHA tokens and audit-ready metadata. Teams should demonstrate 1. Ingesting the NAMASTE CSV export and generating FHIR CodeSystem + ConceptMap. 2. Fetching TM2, Biomedicine updates from the WHO ICD-API and merging into your service. 3. A simple web or CLI interface to search NAMASTE terms, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, see mapped TM2 codes, and construct a FHIR ProblemList entry. 4. Version tracking and consent metadata to satisfy India’s 2016 EHR Standards (FHIR R4, ISO 22600, SNOMED-CT/LOINC semantics). Expected Solution A lightweight, FHIR R4–compliant terminology micro-service—built to India’s 2016 EHR Standards—that exposes a NAMASTE CodeSystem, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, an ICD-11 TM2, Biomedicine ConceptMap, an auto-complete value-set lookup endpoint, a NAMASTE↔TM2 translate operation; ICD-11 Biomedicine look up and a secure FHIR Bundle upload interface (for enabling double coding).",

          "description": "Background The Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines. A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation. Description A permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger. When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing. Expected Solution Participants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities: 1. Permissioned Blockchain Network • A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction. • Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers. • Smart contracts enforcing: - Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones. - Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines. - Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks). 2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture • IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record \"CollectionEvent\" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics. • Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for \"QualityTest\" events (lab results) and \"ProcessingStep\" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions). 3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal • On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch. • A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle: - Collection location map and harvest details - Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node - Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication - Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications - Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials 4. Integration & Interoperability • RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics. • Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange. • Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange. 5. User Interfaces & Reporting • A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization. • A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements. • Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies. 6. Demonstration & Evaluation • A live pilot using one botanical species (e.g., Ashwagandha) across a small farming cooperative and a collaborating processor. • End-to-end demonstration: geo-tagging harvest, adding lab results, processing events, QR code scanning by simulated consumers and recall simulation. • Metrics collection on data-capture latency, transaction throughput, offline sync reliability and consumer-scan engagement. By delivering these elements, participants will showcase a replicable, transparent and sustainable model for botanical traceability that bridges traditional Ayurvedic sourcing with modern blockchain technology and consumer empowerment.",

          "description": "Background With increasing digitization, the problem of fake degrees and forged academic certificates has become a major concern for higher education institutions, employers, and government bodies. Cases of fraudulent documents being used for jobs, admissions, or government schemes have highlighted the absence of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of educational credentials issued by colleges and universities. At present, verification is often manual, relying on physical inspection, emails to institutions, or outdated databases. This creates delays, inconsistency, and susceptibility to corruption or manipulation. To preserve academic integrity and public trust, there is a pressing need for an efficient, secure, and scalable digital system to detect and prevent the use of fake degrees. Detailed Description The challenge is to create a digital platform that can authenticate and detect fake degrees or certificates issued by higher education institutions across Jharkhand. The system should be able to cross-verify uploaded documents (PDFs, scans, etc.) with institutional databases or credential registries, using metadata, QR codes, signatures, or embedded hashes. Such a platform must work with both legacy certificates (issued before digitization) and new ones generated under university ERP systems. It should detect anomalies such as: - Tampered grades or photos - Forged seals or signatures - Invalid certificate numbers - Non-existent institutions or courses - Duplicate or cloned documents Incorporating AI, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and blockchain or cryptographic validation, the platform should enable seamless certificate verification by employers, admission offices, scholarship agencies, and government departments. The goal is to create a trustable and publicly accessible system that protects institutions’ reputation and safeguards student achievements. Expected Solution A smart, scalable, and secure Fake Degree/Certificate Recognition system that includes: • Upload interface for verifying entities (employers, institutions, agencies) to upload or input certificate details • Certificate authenticity checker that: – Uses OCR to extract key details (name, roll number, marks, certificate ID) – Matches it against a verified database (centralized or decentralized) – Flags mismatches or formatting inconsistencies • Digital watermark or blockchain verification support for newly issued certificates • Institution integration module for universities/colleges to upload their certificate records in bulk or in real-time • Admin dashboard for authorized bodies (e.g., Higher Education Department) to monitor verification activity, detect forgery trends, and blacklist offenders • Alert system for invalid or forged entries • Data privacy and access control measures to ensure secure handling of student information This solution must be adaptable across different institutions, work with both physical and digital certificates, and be affordable for state-wide rollout.",

Additionally, local artisans, tribal communities, and small-scale service providers who could benefit greatly from tourism remain largely excluded from the digital ecosystem. There is a strong need for a centralized digital platform that not only improves the tourist experience through authentic and accessible information but also connects and empowers local communities, making tourism in Jharkhand more inclusive, organized, and sustainable. Expected Solution Design and develop an AI-powered digital tourism platform (mobile app and/or website) for Jharkhand that offers: • AI-based personalized itinerary planning and multilingual chatbot assistance for tourists. • Blockchain-enabled secure transactions, guide verification, and digital certification for local service providers. • Interactive maps and AR/VR previews of major tourist and cultural sites. • Real-time transport and location info using geo-location. • Integrated local marketplace for tribal handicrafts, events, homestays, and ecotourism. • AI-driven feedback and sentiment analysis for continuous improvement. • Analytics dashboard for tourism officials to monitor trends and impact.",

          "description": "Background Microplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring. Description The project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques. Expected Solution The expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.",

However, measuring grain size is particularly challenging, as it requires scientists to visit each site to collect sediment samples. These samples must then undergo time-consuming physical processing in the laboratory to determine their characteristics. Moreover, because beach sediments are dynamic and constantly changing due to wave action, tides, and weather events, this process must be repeated regularly to maintain accurate and up-to-date data. Description The above problem statement envisages that a low-cost camera-based automated mapping system be developed to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of the sandy beach area (i.e., berm, intertidal, and dune) and classify the beach category of the measurement region. A low-cost camera-based mapping system, along with automated prediction algorithms, is used to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of a particular area of interest to be developed. Also, this system should incorporate a GNSS/GPS receiver to map the geographic positions of the measurement location.

Background India’s vast coastline is vulnerable to a range of ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal currents, and abnormal sea behaviour. While agencies like INCOIS provide early warnings based on satellite data, sensors, and numerical models; real-time field reporting from citizens and local communities are often unavailable or delayed. Additionally, valuable insights from public discussions on social media during hazard events remain untapped, yet can be critical for understanding ground realities, public awareness, and the spread of information. Detailed Description There is a need for a unified platform that enables citizens, coastal residents, volunteers, and disaster managers to report observations during hazardous ocean events (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, coastal damage, tsunami, swell surges, high waves, etc.) and to monitor public communication trends via social media. This platform should: • Allow citizens to submit geotagged reports, photos, or videos of observed ocean hazards via a mobile/web app. • Support role-based access for citizens, officials, and analysts. • Aggregate and visualize real-time crowdsourced data on a dynamic dashboard. • Visualize all crowdsourced reports and social media indicators on an interactive map, with hotspots dynamically generated based on report density, keyword frequency, or verified incidents. • Integrate social media feeds (e.g., Twitter, public Facebook posts, YouTube comments) and apply Text Classification/Natural Language Processing to extract hazard-related discussions and trends. • Help emergency response agencies understand the scale, urgency, and sentiment of hazard events. • Provide filters by location, event type, date, and source, enabling better situational awareness and faster validation of warning models.

Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data requires domain knowledge, technical skills, and familiarity with complex formats and tools. With the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with modern structured databases and interactive dashboards, it is now feasible to create intuitive, accessible systems that democratize access to ocean data. Description The current problem statement proposes the development of an AI-powered conversational system for ARGO float data that enables users to query, explore, and visualize oceanographic information using natural language. The current system shall: − Ingest ARGO NetCDF files and convert them into structured formats (like SQL/Parquet). − Use a vector database (like FAISS/Chroma) to store metadata and summaries for retrieval. − Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by multimodal LLMs (such as GPT, QWEN, LLaMA, or Mistral) to interpret user queries and map them to database queries (SQL). (Use Model Context Protocol (MCP)) − Enable interactive dashboards (via Streamlit or Dash) for visualization of ARGO profiles, such as mapped trajectories, depth-time plots, and profile comparisons, etc. − Provide a chatbot-style interface where users can ask questions like: • Show me salinity profiles near the equator in March 2023 • Compare BGC parameters in the Arabian Sea for the last 6 months • What are the nearest ARGO floats to this location? This tool will bridge the gap between domain experts, decision-makers, and raw data by allowing non-technical users to extract meaningful insights effortlessly.

The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling. Background India, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management. Detailed description CMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management. CMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching. Why It Matters This platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights. Expected Deliverables • A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype. • Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines. • Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends. • Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data. • Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling.",

          "description": "Background The deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure. Description The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing. However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity. Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets. Expected Solution To address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an AI-driven pipeline that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.",

          "description": "Background The majority of the farmers in India store the onion in naturally ventilated storage structures. In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity. Description Onion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations. Various abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges. Expected Solution Extension of shelf life with minimum loss.",

IEC 60898-1:2015 mandates rigorous short-circuit breaking capacity tests, crucial for ensuring MCBs perform correctly under severe fault conditions. Existing Problem Current manual or semi-automated testing methods for MCBs introduce significant challenges. These include imprecise R (resistive) and XL (inductive) circuit configurations, increased test times, and elevated safety risks for personnel during high-energy fault current generation (up to 10,000A). This impacts test accuracy, repeatability, and overall safety in the MCB certification process. Detailed Description This proposal outlines an automated machine to precisely control test currents, voltages, and circuit impedance, executing high-current short-circuit tests on single pole, SPN, DP, TP, and FP MCBs (0.5A-63A) per IEC 60898-1:2015.

          "description": "Background Accurate and consistent preparation of cable specimens is vital for reliable testing according to Indian Standards like IS 10810 (Parts 2, 7, 33) and IS 7098 (Parts 1 & 2). These tests, including conductor resistance, insulation/sheath thickness, and flame retardance, are crucial for ensuring cable safety and quality. Existing Problem Currently, cable sample preparation involves significant manual intervention. The cable sample is manually cut by the operator and then straightened manually. Subsequently, these straightened PVC/XLPE/HDPE cable samples are cut into slices using electrically/pneumatically operated machines. Further, the samples are shaped as dumbbells by a dumbbell cutting machine. These manual and semi-automated steps are time-consuming, prone to human error, and introduce inconsistencies that compromise the accuracy and repeatability of critical test results. Detailed Description This project develops an automated machine designed to precisely cut insulation and outer sheaths from cables, preparing specimens that strictly adhere to the aforementioned IS standards. Key features include an Automated Cable Feeding and Clamping System utilizing motor-driven rollers and adjustable clamps for secure, straightened cable handling. The Cutting and Stripping Module employs precision blades with programmable depths for clean, circumferential cuts and linear stripping, fulfilling specific length requirements for various tests. An integrated diameter sensor will auto-adjust settings. A Control System (PLC/HMI) manages operations, allows test method selection, monitors status, and provides closed-loop feedback. Automated specimen ejection and waste management further streamline workflow. Robust safety features like enclosed areas and interlocks will protect operators. Expected Solution The automated machine will eliminate human error, guaranteeing consistent and repeatable specimen quality while significantly reducing preparation time and costs. By ensuring strict adherence to IS standards, the solution will yield more reliable test results and simplify product certification. This advancement will markedly improve accuracy, efficiency, and safety in cable testing, supporting high-quality control in the cable manufacturing industry.",

          "description": "Background: Hallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts. The Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts. The fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes. Further, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery. There is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method. India's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking. In the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method. Expected Solution: a. Develop and implement a non-destructive assaying method that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances). b. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes). c. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418). d. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications. Deliverables: a. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanation b. References/bibliography related to the technical paper c. Scientific principles underlying the approach d. Feasibility studies and expected challenges e. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessment f. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application",

          "description": "Background In FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management. Description Overview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management. Waste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country. Solid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG. Expected Solutions The proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows: 1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills. i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc. ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen. iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen. iv. App-based monitoring. 2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers 3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc. i. Training of all Waste Generators ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected iii. Waste Collection happening on ground level iv. Waste transportation v. Waste treatment vi. Waste Disposal 4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation. 5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation. 6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector. 7. Penalization system: Fines to be imposed and no waste collection for buildings not segregating waste at source as punishment. 8. Waste Management Facilities to be made available in every ULB: i. Biomethanization plant ii. W-to-E plant iii. Multiple Recycling centres for different types of waste iv. Scrap collection shops – Online app based 9. Complete Digital App-based system for: i. Training of all Waste Generators ii. Shopping of Waste utilities – compost kits, dustbins, etc. iii. Tracking of Waste collection vehicles iv. Location of Waste management facilities, Recycling centres, scrap shops etc. v. Option to upload geo-tagged photos of dumping sites, etc.",

Recently, several cases of accidental deaths of children and adults due to electrocution from broken live conductors lying on the ground were reported in Kerala. Low voltage distribution lines often snap due to falling trees during natural calamities and also due to aging or corrosion. This dangerous condition is not detected or isolated by upstream fuses in these feeders because of high earth resistance and low fault current, leading to electrocution deaths when people come into contact with live bare conductors. Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.

These systems are connected to low voltage distribution feeders either in single-phase or three-phase mode. A majority of the systems are below 5 kW and hence get connected in single-phase, which causes severe unbalanced loading in feeders and results in an uneven voltage profile. This unbalanced loading also limits the quantum of PV that can be integrated into the network. Any load balancing work carried out during daytime under PV injection gets negated during the evening peak hours when solar power is unavailable. This situation calls for a solution that can dynamically reconfigure the network based on renewable energy (RE) injection and local demand scenarios. Expected Solution A cost-effective controller incorporating IoT and edge intelligence can be developed at the local node level for auto-balancing of the load across various phases in a feeder under the above conditions.",

          "description": "Background Groundwater is central to India's drinking, agricultural, and industrial water needs. Despite covering an area of 3.3 million square kilometers and being home to 16% of the global population, India has only 4% of the world's freshwater resources. This limited availability, combined with uneven distribution, overexploitation in some regions, and changing climate scenarios, highlights the urgent need for sustainable groundwater management. Resource knowledge is integral to the effective management of resources. Proposed Solution To strengthen groundwater management, it is proposed to design a mobile application that utilizes data from 5,260 DWLR (Digital Water Level Recorder) stations spread across the country. These stations provide high-frequency water level data, which can be leveraged to: - Analyze real-time water level fluctuations - Estimate recharge dynamically - Evaluate groundwater resources in real time Key Features - Mobile app integration with DWLR station datasets - Visualization of water level trends and recharge patterns - Real-time groundwater availability estimation - Decision-support features for researchers, planners, and policymakers Impact The designed app will enable stakeholders, groundwater researchers, and decision makers to have quick access to real-time groundwater availability. This will aid in scientific evaluation, informed decision-making, and the proposal of effective groundwater management interventions.",

          "description": "Background As industries increasingly emphasize sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is emerging not just as a tool for measuring environmental impact, but as a key strategy for advancing circularity. Metals like aluminium and copper, vital to sectors from energy to infrastructure, undergo multiple stages — from extraction and processing to use and end-of-life. Traditional linear models often result in resource depletion and waste. Modern LCA frameworks now assess not only emissions and resource use, but also the potential for reuse, recycling, and closed-loop systems. By informing decisions on product design, manufacturing, and end-of-life recovery, LCA enables a shift toward a circular economy where materials are kept in use longer and waste is minimized. Problem Statement There is a need to design an intuitive, AI-powered software platform that enables metallurgists, engineers, and decision-makers to perform automated LCAs for metals such as aluminium, copper, or critical minerals, with a special emphasis on circularity. Proposed Solution The platform should: - Allow users to input or select process and production details (including raw vs. recycled routes, energy use, transport, and end-of-life options). - Use AI/ML models to estimate missing parameters and predict both environmental and circularity indicators (e.g., recycled content, resource efficiency, extended product life, potential for reuse). - Visualize circular flow opportunities alongside environmental impacts across the full value chain — from raw material extraction through reuse or recycling. - Enable easy comparison of conventional and circular processing pathways. - Generate actionable reports and recommendations for reducing impacts and enhancing circularity, even when users have limited data or specialized expertise. Impact With this tool, the metals sector will be empowered to make practical, data-driven choices that foster environmental sustainability while advancing circular, resource-efficient systems.",

          "description": "Background India is facing a growing e-waste crisis, generating over 1.75 million tonnes annually. A key reason why millions of old laptops and smartphones remain unused or improperly discarded is fear of data breaches. Most users hesitate to recycle their devices due to concerns about sensitive personal or organizational data being recovered. Existing data sanitization tools are either too complex, expensive, or lack verifiable proof of erasure. This gap has led to over ₹50,000 crore worth of IT assets being hoarded in homes and offices, hindering circular economy efforts. A user-friendly, tamper-proof, and auditable data wiping solution is urgently needed to promote safe disposal and reuse of electronic devices. Problem Statement Design and prototype a secure, cross-platform data wiping application that works on Windows, Linux, and Android devices. The tool must: - Securely erase all user data, including hidden storage areas like HPA/DCO and SSD sectors. - Generate a digitally signed, tamper-proof wipe certificate (in PDF and JSON formats). - Feature an intuitive one-click interface suitable for general public use. - Offer offline usability (e.g., bootable ISO/USB). - Enable third-party verification of wipe status. - Be scalable, standards-compliant (aligned with NIST SP 800-88), and support trust and transparency in IT asset disposal and recycling workflows.

          "description": "Background The current dewatering system at our copper mining site relies heavily on electrically operated pumps, often supplemented by diesel generators during power outages. This traditional setup not only leads to high operational expenses due to electricity and fuel consumption, but also contributes to increased carbon emissions, operational complexity, and maintenance challenges. In light of rising energy costs and the need for reliable and sustainable mine dewatering solutions, there is a pressing need to explore alternative approaches. Solar-powered dewatering systems offer a viable solution, leveraging renewable energy to reduce costs, ensure consistent pump operation, and support broader environmental and sustainability goals. Implementing such systems under an OPEX (Operational Expenditure) model aligns with the strategy to minimize capital expenditure while transitioning to cleaner and more efficient mining practices. Problem This outlines the implementation of solar-powered dewatering pumps at the copper mining site under an OPEX model. The system will integrate solar photovoltaic (PV) modules with energy-efficient submersible or surface pumps, designed to meet site-specific dewatering requirements. A third-party vendor will be engaged to install, operate, and maintain the system through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or operational lease, eliminating the need for upfront capital investment by HCL. The system can be configured as stand-alone solar or hybrid (solar with grid/diesel backup) to ensure uninterrupted pumping. The proposed solution aims to reduce operational energy costs, enhance dewatering reliability, and support environmental commitments by minimizing diesel use and lowering carbon emissions. Technical specifications are attached. Expected Solution Deployment of solar-powered, energy-efficient dewatering pumps under an OPEX model to ensure reliable, low-cost, and eco-friendly mine dewatering. The system will reduce diesel and electricity usage, include hybrid backup, and feature vendor-managed operation and maintenance.",

          "description": "Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: ● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. ● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening. ● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. ● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. ● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. As KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.",

          "description": "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: 1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments. 2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. 3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. 4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. 5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. 6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. At present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone: ● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. ● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. ● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. ● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: ● Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. ● Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). ● Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation. ● Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. Such a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process—delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.",

          "description": "Background: With the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, all higher education institutions-including Institutes of Teacher Education and general degree colleges-have transitioned to Four-Year Undergraduate Programmes (FYUP) and integrated teacher education programs like B.Ed., M.Ed., and ITEP. These programs feature flexible, creditbased, multidisciplinary structures allowing students to choose Major, Minor, Skill-Based, Ability Enhancement, and Value-Added courses. Manual timetable creation under this new framework has become extremely complex, involving numerous subject combinations, varying credit hours, student preferences, and faculty workload distribution. To manage this, colleges usually form dedicated timetable committees, but even then, clashes, underutilization of faculty, and scheduling inefficiencies persist. Description: This problem statement envisions the development of a web-based or hybrid intelligent system that can generate automated, conflict-free, optimized academic timetables alignment with the NEP 2020 course structure. The system must integrate: - Student data (elective choices, enrolled credits) - Curriculum structure (course codes, credits, theory/practical split) - Faculty workload, availability, and expertise - Room/lab availability and capacity - Teaching practice schedules (especially relevant for B.Ed. and M.Ed.) - Field work, internships, and project components The system should also allow dynamic editing, scenario simulation, and scalability for upcoming semesters. A user-friendly admin interface is essential to allow real-time inputs and updates. Expected Solution: A deployable AI/ML-assisted Timetable Generator that: - Accepts structured inputs from academic, student, and faculty databases - Generates a semester-wise timetable for multiple programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP) - Prevents scheduling conflicts across faculty and infrastructure - Accommodates future course additions and changing NEP guidelines - Offers exportable formats (PDF, Excel) for student and faculty sharing - Can be integrated with existing Academic Management Systems",

          "description": "Problem Statement: Context: Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges. Problem Faced: - Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system. - Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools. - Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness. - No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions. Proposed Technological Challenge: Develop a Digital Psychological Intervention System (web-based and/or mobile app) with the following capabilities: 1. AI-guided First-Aid Support: Interactive chat box that offers coping strategies and refers students to professionals when needed. 2. Confidential Booking System: For appointment with on-campus counsellor or mental health helpline. 3. Psychoeducational Resource Hub: Videos, relaxation audio, mental wellness guides in regional languages. 4. Peer Support Platform: Moderated peer-to-peer support forum with trained student volunteers. 5. Admin Dashboard: Anonymous data analytics for authorities to recognize trends and plan interventions. Department/Section Owning the Problem: Department of Student Welfare / Department of Psychology / Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC). Problem Explanation Video: To be prepared by students. Need for Digital Platform for Psychological Support: Most available apps are generic, Western-oriented, or paid. They do not integrate: • Regional cultural context and language • Institution-specific customization • Offline support mapping (e.g., linking with college counsellors) • Real-time analytics for admin Hence, a tailored open-source solution is needed. Sample Data/Data Structures for Participants: • Level of problem through standard psychological screening tools (PHQ-9 / GAD-7 / GHQ, etc.) • Mock student profiles (anonymized) • Institutional support structure (counsellor availability, resources, helpline)",

          "description": "Background: Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including: - Conferences and workshops attended - Certifications earned - Club activities and volunteering efforts - Competitions and academic contests - Leadership roles and internships - Community services done This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge. Description: The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform. Key Features include: - Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities. - Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars. - Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility. - Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format. - Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations. - Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms. Impact and Benefits: - Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile. - Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications. - Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations. - Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued. - Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level. Expected Solution: We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will: - Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1 - Reduce paperwork and improve transparency - Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions - Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking - Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions - Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy audits This will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations.",

          "description": "Background The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about: - Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for. - What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges. - What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course. - Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible. This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education. Description The above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. Key Features of the App/Web Platform: - Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion: Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations. - Course-to-Career Path Mapping: Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream. - Nearby Government Colleges Directory: Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access). - Timeline Tracker: Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules. - Customization and Personalization: User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests: • Courses to apply for. • Colleges nearby. • Career paths aligned with their aptitude. • Study materials tailored to subject choice. Implementation Strategy - Stakeholder Collaboration: Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach. - Technology Development: Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas. - Pilot Launch: Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers. - Full-Scale Rollout: Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers. - Monitoring & Feedback: Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment. Expected Solution We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships. Impact - Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions. - Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12. - Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance. - Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.",

          "description": "Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors. Manually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted. To address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process. The solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning. Proposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.

Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide. Description: The challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions. Expected Solution: Student teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences.",

Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier. Description: Attendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously. Commercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system must be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using machine learning. Expected SoIution: Participants are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.",

Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview. Description: Comprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate. Expected Solution: Teams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.",

Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement.

          "description": "Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each. Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine ├ö├ç├┤ The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important. TKPH: Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation. TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour) Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift. Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory. More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must. Actions required: The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL├ö├ç├ûs dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle├ö├ç├ûs Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition. Tyre Pressure Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources. Expected Solution: Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Tyre Performance Analysis Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres. Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.",

          "description": "Background: ln Science Museums/ Centres exhibits are mostly interactive in nature. Interactive exhibits are the lifeblood of science centers, but keeping them functioning smoothly can be a challenge. It poses the problem of regular maintenance. It has also been observed that defects remain unattended for long due to not being identified. It creates a genuine problem for the visitors' experience and sometimes they are not aware of the optimum result. Here lines the requirement for an automated defective exhibit identification system. Description: It is a real-life problem in big Museum/ Science Museum/Centres, where there is inadequacy of manpower. Following are the problems in a nutshell that arose due to unnoticed and undiagnosed defects of the exhibits. High Maintenance Needs: Unlike static displays, interactive elements have more moving parts, software, and technology that require regular upkeep to function properly these are considered as \"\"golden parameters of any particular Exhibits\"\". Theses parameters are to be kept functional to keep the exhibits in a running condition. Frustration for Visitors: Encountering a non-functional exhibit can be frustrating for visitors, especially children, who may not understand why it's not working. Missed Learning Opportunities: Broken/ non-functional exhibits prevent visitors from fully engaging with the science concepts they're designed to teach. Because of their complexity, malfunctions might not be immediately obvious to visitors or staff, leading to a broken experience. Also creates a bad impression for that particular gallery and ultimately to the science center or to Science Museums. Expected Solution: Now, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, it transpires that amalgamation of Al with automation may give efficient result to detect defective exhibits placed in the galleries and give the feedback to the concerned section for immediate repairing initiative and rectify the exhibits. Thus, aiming a flawless learning experience or edutainment in Science Museum or in Science Center.",

          "description": "Background: Milk is perishable product, it requires immediate processing after few hours (2-4Hrs) of production, otherwise, bacterial load increases and milk gets deteriorate. At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons. Description: The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions. Take 10 ml milk sample in sterile MBRT test tube. Add 1 ml MBRT dye solution (dye concentration 0.005%). Stopper the tubes with sterilized rubber stopper and carefully place them in a test tube stand dipped in a serological water bath maintained at 37t1oC. Record this time as the beginning of the incubation period. Decolourization is considered complete when only a faint blue ring (about 5mm) persists at the top. However, for processed dairy products, the enumeration of bacterial load is time-consuming and requires different methods. Expected solution: The above mentioned MBRT takes 4 to 6 Hours for completion of the test. Therefore, it is proposed to develop cost effective, rapid and portable method/Machine to deduct microbial load in Raw and Pasteurized Milk as compared to present Methylene blue reduction test (MBRT).Meanwhile, smart packaging tools such as freshness indicators could be a solution for processed dairy products.ln this context, artificial intelligence, machine vision, systems, etc. could be explored.",

          "description": "Background: lndia has emerged as leading milk producer country in the world, however productivity of dairy animals is very low. To improve the productivity of animals a major focus area is to breed these animals using semen from high genetic merit bulls through Artificial lnsemination (Al). Al enables farmers to access the best bull (male) genetics. Farmers can improve the production, health traits, fertility and longevity of their dairy cattle by using a balanced approach to breeding. Animal health is also improved through the use of Al. Description: For Al, the semen is inseminated into the female by placing a portion of it either in a collected or diluted form into the cervix or uterus by mechanical methods at the proper time and under most hygienic conditions. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery system in lndia. Semen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation. Expected solution: . There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses . The design, material, type of insulation of storage containers can also help in cost effectiveness, reduction in losses, compactness and ease of carrying to facilitate efficient distribution.",

          "description": "Background: Dual use precursor chemicals are substances that have legitimate industrial and commercial applications but can also be used in the illicit manufacture of drugs. For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985. Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances) Expected Solution: A hardware/software/chemical solution for end-to-end tracking of dual use chemicals used in both legitimate industries and illicit drug production from point of manufacture to point of end use/export",

Automatic change detection on such images have wider application for various use cases. Description: Change detection between two SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images are straight forward if they are co-registered as the difference or ratio of corresponding pixels of the two images itself will give the change map. But such change maps will invariably have many natural changes as well like water body extent, flood extent, snow cover and forest cover changes etc. Our interest is to detect only man made changes and avoid natural changes. The solution can make use of Sentinel 1 SAR Open source satellite images and Google Earth Engine platform to access them. These images are co-registered by default. The GRD (Ground Range Detected) intensity image version of the Sentinel 1 SAR is to be used. Please note that images with same viewing geometry are better suited for change detection purposes. The solution should give the option for the user to vary the thresholds if any used for filtering change results. The change output should be in the form of polygons in a geographically referenced vector file. The solution should be scalable, means should be able to run on huge areas of interest and generate change alerts. The criteria for winning solution would be minimum false alarms with regard to man made changes.

An essential aspect of the mission's success is not only ensuring access to water but also guaranteering its quality. Residual chlorine/Silver ion levels indicate the efficacy of water disinfection, bacteriological contamination poses significant health risks. Existing methods for testing water quality at the household level often lack reliability, accessibility, and affordability. The main aim of the technology challenge is to develop three distinct personalised testing kits (For measuring Residual chlorine, residual silver ion and/or for Bacteriological contamination) that are cost-effective, easy to use, and could measure both residual chlorine levels and bacteriological contamination at the household level. Thse devices are intented to empower rural communities to conduct their own assessments of water quality, enabling prompt action to ensure safe drinking water. Expected Solutions: i. The device should be portable and accurate in detecting low levels of residual chlorine (As per BIS 10500: 2012, acceptable limit: 0.2 mg/liter), residual silver ions and/or bacteriological contamination (E. coli & Total coliform- As per BIS 10500: 2012, it shall not be detectable in any 100 ml of sample), ensuring reliable results comparable to laboratory-grade equipment. ii. The detected value indicates the level of chlorine/silver ion/bacteria (E.Coli) present in 100 ml water. The output of the test should be in digital mode; iii. The personalized testing kits should be affordable for rural households, easy to carry & use and requiring minimal training for operation by individuals. iv. The personalized testing kits should be robust and able to withstand harsh environmental conditions prevalent in rural India, suhc as temperature fulctuations and humidity. v.

As a result of this water flows from such well automatically and pumping devices are not required. Such autoflow wells are observed mostly in the Terai region of India. As shown by the aquifer mapping studies, the extents of autoflow areas are shrinking in parts of Uttarakhand and elsewhere. Many private wells in these terrains are without any cap or tap and water flows continuously leading to huge groundwater losses. Further, measurement of head (water level) in these wells is a challenge as water flows automatically from these wells. Usually an additional pipe is attached above the ground level and the water level in such a pipes is measured manually. The proposal is to develop a device that can serve two purposes- i) it will work as a safe cap for the well with a tap for regulating water flow and ii) a pressure transducer based sensor that can sense the pressure and translate it in terms of height (in m) above ground level",

          "description": "Background: The use of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) technology for estimation of seasonal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of crops at various growth stages is well establishd. Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.",

          "description": "Background: The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind presents significant challenges due to their intermittent nature. This variability can strain the power grid, leading to inefficiencies and reliability issues. Traditional grid infrastructure is not designed to handle these fluctuations effectively, resulting in energy wastage and a reliance on fossil fuel-based backup power. Energy storage systems (ESS) offer a potential solution by storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during times of high demand or low generation, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply. Description: The task is to design an innovative and efficient energy storage system to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources and stabilize the grid. This requires addressing several key challenges: high costs, technological limitations, and regulatory barriers. Current ESS technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flow batteries, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Innovative ideas need to be explored to reduce costs, enhance storage capacities, and improve the efficiency and lifespan of these technologies. Additionally, how to navigate and potentially reform regulatory frameworks to support the widespread adoption of ESS may also be explored. Expected Solution: Develop approaches to lower the initial and operational costs of ESS, potentially through new materials, manufacturing processes, or economies of scale. Identify or create advanced ESS technologies that offer higher efficiency, greater storage capacity, and longer operational lifespans. Suggest changes to policies and regulations that facilitate ESS integration, including safety standards, performance metrics, and grid interconnection protocols. Formulate strategies to engage key stakeholders, including policymakers, utility companies, and consumers, to build support for ESS deployment.

Unlike its fossil fuel counterpart, green hydrogen emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of use, making it ideal for hard-to-electrify sectors like heavy industry, long-distance transport, and steel production. This clean fuel can power vehicles and industrial processes, slashing emissions and combating climate change. Furthermore, green hydrogen's potential for energy storage allows for a more balanced and resilient renewable energy grid. As we strive for a net-zero future, green hydrogen is a crucial tool for a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow. Description: Green hydrogen's potential for clean energy is undeniable. However, its widespread adoption faces a significant roadblock: high levelized cost. This cost, encompassing production, storage, and transportation, makes green hydrogen less competitive compared to traditional fossil fuels. This disparity discourages industries from switching to green alternatives. Government incentives, technological advancements, and economies of scale are all crucial to bridge this cost gap. Only then can green hydrogen fulfil its promise as a transformative force in the fight against climate change.

The country's industrial heritage was built upon indigenous coal. Our countries major production of Electricity is achieved through coal fired thermal power plant which is around 3/4th of the total power generation and also the biggest source of Carbon emission. India updated its NDC according to which the target: To reduce emissions intensity of its GDP has been enhanced to 45% by 2030 from 2005 level. India's also creating energy transition pathway to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to reduce the effects of climate change and promote sustainability. However, owning to energy security issue the role of coal cannot be ruled out in immediate future till various storage solution gets mature and become available at affordable cost. Description: Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology that can help India meet its energy security and emission reduction goals. CCUS can be retrofitted to existing power and industrial plants, allowing for their continued operation. CCS was acknowledged as a solution for climate mitigation by IPCC. However, IPCC also noted that CCS has the highest cost and lowest possible contribution to net emission reduction in both energy and industry sectors. This problem is having potential opportunity for innovators, researchers and start-ups. In order to meet the 1.5Ôö¼ÔûæC goal, IPCC projects the need to have technical geological storage of about 1,000 GtCO2. However, the availability of geological storage is highly location dependent and there are several technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and socio-cultural barriers to implementing CCS, according to IPCC.

The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this. Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example: 60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam 40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam 30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam. Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student├ö├ç├ûs responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks. Expected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.",

          "description": "Background: As per the census 2011, Disability is more common in elderly people. One of the major reasons for disability among the elderly people is falls. Every year, one-third of community-dwelling older adults (adults aged 65 and older) experience a fall. Falls, defined as ├ö├ç┬úunexpected event[s] in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level,├ö├ç├ÿ are responsible for a wide range of negative health outcomes. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults, and the age-adjusted fall death rate (64 deaths per 100,000 older adults) increased by 30%. Additionally, the psychological impact of falling can cause older adults and their caregivers significant fear about the risk of falling again. This fear of falling can have an accumulating effect whereby the fear of falling causes individuals to limit their everyday physical activities, which in turn makes them weaker and more susceptible to future falls. In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual├ö├ç├ûs strength, balance, and mobility Description: Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants├ö├ç├û presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people. Expected Solution: These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers",

          "description": "Background: With the loss of an upper limb, activities of daily living (ADL) become more challenging for the affected person. Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect. Description of Problem statement: A myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. Expected Solutions: Experts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.",

          "description": "Description: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class. Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately. Detailed Description: Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler├ö├ç├ûs, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis. A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification. Expected Solution: Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird Output: Class of the object(Drone or Bird)",

          "description": "Background: The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand. Description: The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs. Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive. Expected Solution: An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.",

          "description": "Background: There are numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes in Rajasthan running under the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. Notably, during the admission process, there is a significant increase in enquiries from various groups, including students, their parents, and other stakeholders. These enquiries cover a wide range of queries related to admission process, eligibility criteria, information about different colleges, fee structure, curriculum , scholarship , hostel facilities, previous year's college and branch-specific allotments placement opportunities and many more. Currently, stakeholders have tocontact colleges individually through phone or email, and sometimes even visit the colleges personally. This process is not only cumbersome for the stakeholders but also demanding to pool manpower for the colleges to manage these inquiries. Detailed Description: With the continuous rise in enquiries, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the colleges to respond promptly and effectively using traditional communication methods. To address this issue more efficiently and ensure timely assistance for everyone, there is a pressing need to adopt new technological solutions. One effective approach is to develop an AI-powered chatbot at centralized level that would serve as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to answer a wide range of questions. By automating responses to common enquiries, the chatbot would significantly enhance the accessibility to important information and allow staff to focus on handling more complex queries and other critical tasks. For example, the chatbot would provide insights into information about various engineering and polytechnic colleges that falls under the jurisdiction of Department of Technical Education, and guide users through the admission processes, explain fee structures, share curriculum updates, provide details about available scholarships, share alumni information, and share information on job placement opportunities etc This will empower the technical education department because of the ease of providing information, help and advice instantly to prospective students, their parents, and all interested parties. The required information provided by all colleges can be integrated with ease in software. Expected Solutions: 1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot should rapidly access and provide accurate information from a comprehensive database on topics such as admissions, fees, scholarships, recommendations based on previous years cutoff, minimizing the need for human assistance. Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to support voice based assistance in English languages and can be extended in Hindi and other regional languages ensuring wide accessibility and understanding. 2. Enhanced User Experience: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The interface should be straightforward, accessible on common platform, and capable of understanding natural language, ensuring user-friendliness. 3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ├ö├ç├ûs), the chatbot will reduce the workload on department staff, allowing them to concentrate on more complex and urgent tasks. 4. Data Insights: The chatbot will gather valuable data from user interactions, helping the department to identify common concerns and optimize it├ö├ç├ûs services based on these insights.",

          "description": "Background: India faces a complex challenge in balancing its reliance on coal for energy with its climate change commitments. Coal mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality, the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can be done through a combination of strategies like reducing emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to carbon neutrality. Description: The web based application will have following objectives: Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal Mines Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks Gap analysis between C emission and sinks and suggesting pathways to carbon neutrality Expected Solution: A comprehensive software solution that includes: Emission estimation: The app would allow users to input data on various mining activities (e.g., excavation, transportation, equipment usage) and estimate the associated carbon emissions based on establishd emission factors. Estimation of Per Capita emissions of a Mine. Carbon Neutrality Pathways: The app could offer features for simulating different emission reduction strategies like: Clean technologies: Assessing the impact of adopting electric vehicles, methane capture systems, and renewable energy sources for mine operations. Afforestation offsets: Calculating the amount of land required for tree plantation to offset remaining emissions based on state specific afforestation plan and Carbon emission reduction. Other Renewables: explore alternative use of energy to reduce direct electricity consumption. Any other pathways: Carbon Credits: Estimation of potential Carbon credit earned as per present market rates. Data visualization: The app should present results visually, using charts and graphs to track emission trends and the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Scalability: Design the app to accommodate different mine sizes and types (underground vs open-cast). Benefits: Transparency: Providing a clear picture of a mine's carbon footprint. Decision support: Helping mine operators make informed choices for emission reduction.

          "description": "Background: Despite the thrust on energy transition from fossil fuel sector to a cost-competitive renewable energy sector, Coal will remain pivotal to energy security of the nation in near future. India is targeting for 1.5 Bt coal production by 2030 to cater to the burgeoning energy needs of the country. To achieve the target, improved productivity and safety in coal mining is pivotal. Description: The problem statement is divided into two parts: one is Digital shift handover log system and other is safety management plan as per DGMS guidelines. A digital shift handover log system is a valuable tool for streamlining and improving the transition of responsibilities and information from one shift to the next within an organization. The problem statement envisages that an app based and web based Shift handover log system be developed as per the Statutory and non-statutory log format currently in practice, which is presently being done manually through paper logs. This will ensure sharing of critical information and briefing of the next shift digitally. It will provide supervisors and operators with an immediate, comprehensive overview of the outgoing shift├ö├ç├ûs activities. Manual Shift handover causes loss of time and thus productivity of the mining operation. Also, some important information regarding safety may get skipped in the manual system which can cause serious damage to mining operation or loss of life. Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same. This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine. Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. Possible Solution: An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines. Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.",

          "description": "Background: Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks. ├ö├ç├│ Description: The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS. Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack: 1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range 2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version 3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint 4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes) There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also. For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made: 1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users. 2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability). 3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS). 4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver. 5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure. A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack. Expected Solution: A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.",

Preventing spills through stringent regulations, improved technology, and better safety practices is crucial to mitigate these devastating effects. Automatic oil spill detection using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and satellite datasets is essential for environmental protection, public health and safety, economic stability, regulatory enforcement, technological advancement, and operational efficiency. This approach enables timely and effective responses to oil spills, mitigating their impact and promoting sustainable maritime practices. Integrating AIS and satellite datasets significantly enhances the early detection of oil spills at sea by combining real-time vessel tracking with advanced remote sensing capabilities. Detailed description: The automatic identification of oil leaks and spills from ships and vessels using AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite datasets involves integrating real-time tracking and advanced remote sensing technologies to monitor marine environments effectively. AIS provides crucial information such as the vessel's unique identifiers (IMO number, call sign), real-time positional data (latitude, longitude), speed over ground (SOG), course over ground (COG), heading, type of vessel, dimensions, draught, destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and cargo details. To detect a vessel in distress, AIS data have to be monitored for anomalies, such as sudden changes in speed or course, erratic movements, or unexpected stops. These irregularities can signal potential distress, prompting further investigation. Once detecting the distress, the same location/vessel have to be monitored using space borne satellite datasets for oil leaks, orientation of the vessel and its change in datum. The integration of AIS data with satellite datasets, enhances the ability to detect oil leaks early and can respond to situations efficiently.

          "description": "Background: INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis. Detailed Description: Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. Data input, classification and arrangement The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight. Users, Data output and visualization The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth. -In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence. Data Accessibility The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data. Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.",

          "description": "Background: Most of the goods are transported around the world by shipping which relies heavily on fossil fuels for powering. Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry. Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship├ö├ç├ûs motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

          "description": "Background: In an institute environment, multiple users often require access to the same datasets for various purposes. However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes. Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields. The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ. If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes. This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency. Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy. This system has to be applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, government agencies, and more.",

          "description": "Background: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations members in 2015, created 17 world Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity├ö├ç├ûs relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/). Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html. Expected Solution: The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly. The solution should be suitable for windows and android environments (web and browser based) and scalable over the time by the host institute independently post-SIH",

The proposed architecture to provide Face Authentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism. The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and reverse engineering. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated. To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the browser context. The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives. 1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering. 2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience. 3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user├ö├ç├ûs desktop. 3. Expected Solution. The expected outcome of this project is a functional solution that incorporates the security of the ML model at the edge. The backend for the proposed solution system must be designed to handle the high volume of transactions that is expected for any population-scale solutions.",

These portals are protected with CAPTCHA for denial of service- related attacks. UIDAI believes that CAPTCHA is a barrier to smooth resident engagement with the aadhaar portals and therefore intends to remove it soon. Instead of active CAPTCHA, UIDAI is looking for a passive solution that can differentiate between a bot and a human operator. 2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to develop a solution, mostly following a passive approach through collection of environmental parameters and using AI/ML to analyze it in the backend to differentiate between bot and human-being. The passive solution may capture environmental details through the browser context and analyze the same with the help of ML models deployed in the backend. This solution, once accepted would be used by the UIDAI to protect all backend APIs from DoS/DDoS based vulnerabilities. The solution must meet the following requirements:- 3. The proposed solution must meet the following objectives. 3.1 Feature Requirements. The solution must define the list of environmental parameters that need to be captured to differentiate between a bot and a human being. If passive parameter analysis is unable to differentiate, then the user may be asked to do a few minimal interactions with the portal. User experience is important to UIDAI and hence human interaction is to be limited. 3.2 Frontend code to capture environmental or human interaction data must be compliant with the javascript framework. Participating teams may choose to use any framework like React/TypeScript/Flutter to demonstrate the solution. 3.3 As part of the solution, the required backend ML model to analyze the front- end capture of environment parameters or human interaction data must be developed to demonstrate the solution. The ML model must be pluggable so that it can be integrated with the UIDAI application stack to protect the APIs. 3.4 The solution must adhere to the core privacy policies of UIDAI. 5.

These devices/application come with vulnerabilities from time to time. There should be timely information sharing mechanism by which the concerned equipment users at critical sector orgs should be altered regarding any critical / high severity vulnerabilities in their equipment within the shortest possible time. Detailed description: The ICT components (HW/SW) being used by Critical Sector Organisations become vulnerable from time to time. These vulnerabilities can be categorised as Critical, High, Medium and Low. Any exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause havoc in multiple Critical Sector Organisations where such vulnerable equipment are being used. Keeping in view of the above, there is a need to monitor all such vulnerability information published at the equipment├ö├ç├ûs OEM websites and also other relevant websites. Once a critical or high severity vulnerability information is published at OEM website or any other relevant website, the ├ö├ç├┐to be developed scrapper├ö├ç├û will immediately take that vulnerability input along with possible mitigating strategy published in the website and send the information to predefined email id(s). Note: The NVD website publishes such OEM vulnerable information. But the same comes with a time lag.

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format. Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems. The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data. It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice. Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures. Expected Solution: Problem Statement: Easy to use and secure redaction tool ├ö├ç┬úRE-DACT├ö├ç├ÿ which allows redaction/masking/anonymization on various input formats based on a gradational scale defined by the user and providing customized output.

          "description": "2.1 Background: 2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs. 2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved. 2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ├ö├ç├┐price reasonability├ö├ç├û for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors. 2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking. 2.2 Detailed Description: 2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows: i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates. ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price. iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey. 2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain. 2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach). 2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs. 2.3 Expected Solution: 2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness. 2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services. 2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.

          "description": "Background: Synthetically-generated audios and videos i.e. deep fakes are in trends nowadays. Although these have caught imagination of computer and tech savvy generation, at the same time, these have created concerns because of their ability to disrupt nation├ö├ç├ûs politics, committing frauds, create dis-information and creating non-consensual contents. Use of Deep fake has also been seen recently to purposefully defame the character of a person in specific. Due to enhancements in AI/ML and Large Language Models for Generative AI, identification and detection of deep fakes have created a huge challenge for Security Agencies. Research on multiple aspects of deep fake identification has been started. As a use case for the problem statement, a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's may be developed. Detailed description: Addressing the deep fake problem requires a multi-pronged approach, combining technology, regulation, education, and collaboration to mitigate the risks and protect individuals and society. However, on the technological front Detecting deep fakes involves development and testing with numerous advanced algorithms and tools. Here are some of the prominent approaches and technologies that can be used in deep fake detection: i.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs can be trained to detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements. CNNs can also analyse video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and discrepancies. ii.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: RNNs and LSTMs can be used to analyse the sequence of frames in a video to detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies indicative of deep fakes. iii.Capsule Networks: Capsule networks can identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture. iv.Adversarial Training: Adversarial training involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deep fakes and simultaneously training another model to detect them improving the robustness of detection algorithms. v.Audio-Visual Inconsistencies: Combining audio and visual analysis can also help detect deep fakes by identifying mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds. vi.Blockchain Technology: Using blockchain to create immutable records of media, providing a verifiable chain of custody for digital content to ensure its authenticity. vii.Frequency Analysis: Analysing the frequency domain of images and videos to detect anomalies and artefacts introduced during the deep fake creation process. viii.Biometric Verification: Analysing subtle behavioural traits such as micro-expressions, eye and head movement to detect anomalies. ix.Hybrid Models: Using a combination of spatial, temporal, audio and frequency analysis to improve the robustness and accuracy of deep fake detection. Expected solution: A solution based on AI/ML technology may be developed to authenticate face-swap deep fake videos in which a person's facial identity is replaced with another's. This technique may be based on any of the above-mentioned methods or it may combine multiple methods and demonstrate the final deliverable of detection of deep fakes with accuracy. The input of the system will be a video which is suspected of deep fake and the output should contain detailed report w.r.t various characteristics of deep fake e.g. whether confirmed fake (details of abnormalities observed), mathematical underlying techniques of its creation.",

Despite the existence of various methods to conserve water, especially in agriculture, the lack of awareness and accessibility to this information perpetuates inefficient water use. This gap in knowledge sharing contributes to the overuse of water resources and exacerbates water stress, particularly in regions where agriculture is heavily dependent on irrigation. Establishing a comprehensive, accessible platform could catalyze the adoption of sustainable practices, crucial for addressing the global challenge of water scarcity. Detailed Description: A centralized knowledge-sharing platform akin to Wikis would facilitate the exchange of innovative methods, successful case studies, and research findings, fostering local and global collaboration. Without it, valuable insights remain siloed, hindering the adoption of practices that could conserve water resources and enhance sustainability. The creation of an accessible, comprehensive repository of water conservation strategies is thus critical for addressing the pressing challenge of water scarcity worldwide. Expected Solution: To address the lack of knowledge sharing platforms on water efficiency, creating a dedicated wiki-style database is the key. This platform would host peer-reviewed articles on water-saving techniques, community forums for sharing local knowledge, videos and interactive tools for calculating water usage and savings. Additionally, integrating social media sharing can amplify reach and engagement, while mobile app development ensures accessibility for users in remote areas, contributing significantly to the reduction of water scarcity globally.",

However, due to increasing population, change in extreme climatic conditions, improvement in agricultural practices there is a necessity for re-evaluation of the current infrastructure and water management practices. Description It is likely that existing dams get silted up over time and are unable to store sufficient water. Due to which there will be a shift in the command area or the cropping pattern. It is also a known fact that changing climate issues is also posing a problem, due to which there is need to review the agricultural requirement. The existing dams and reservoirs are increasingly vulnerable to the adverse climate change and shifts in agricultural practices. These changes can lead to structural stress, altered water availability and inefficiencies in water distribution and usage. There is an urgent need to develop and implement new monitoring and water management models to ensure the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of these critical infrastructures. Expected Solution This problem will address the safety and resilience of dams and reservoirs against climate - induced risks, enhance water resources management and optimally support the agricultural needs and environmental sustainability. There will also be a long-term planning of water infrastructure in the face of climate and agricultural changes. This needs work on the Hydrological impact due to changes in the climatic conditions, which in turn effect the water demand in the command area.

          "description": "Background Hydraulic transients, or water hammer phenomena, occur when there is a sudden change in water flow velocity, causing rapid pressure fluctuations within a hydraulic system. In hydropower and pumped storage schemes, these transients can lead to severe consequences such as pipe bursts, equipment damage, structural failures, and operational inefficiencies. Accurate prediction and management of these transients are essential to maintain the integrity, safety, and efficiency of these systems. Due to certain limitations in the existing models, there is a need for more precise, comprehensive and adaptable models that can simulate complex transient scenarios under varying operational conditions. Description There is a need for developing an advanced hydraulic transient analysis model that can accurately predict and manage the dynamic behavior of water within hydropower and pumped storage systems. This model should provide accurate and reliable results during tripping of units or sudden power failure. Under these conditions, the machine and water conductor system needs to be protected from damages. The time of closure of the guide vanes play an important role in avoiding adverse effects. The delay in closure of guide vanes causes speed rise on the machine and fast closure causes pressure rise issues. The goal is to enhance the resilience and performance of hydropower and pumped storage infrastructures by addressing the causes and consequences of hydraulic transients comprehensively. Expected Solution There is need to develop a sophisticated model that can incorporate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transient behavior of water within the water conductor system. This model should be able to handle complex scenarios such as sudden load changes, emergency shutdowns, start-up and other operational variations. Provide clear visual representations of pressure fluctuations, flow velocities and potential risk areas. This model should be adaptable to different hydropower and pumped storage systems with varying configurations and operational requirements.",

          "description": "Background: Namami Gange is a flagship program of the government of India for the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries. NMCG Authority order of Oct 2016 States the the pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries shall also be monitored by use of satellite and other remote sensing technologies. As pupulations increase in the Ganga Basin, there are growing water demands, and hence higher levels of sewage flow into rivers of the Ganga Basin from both rural and urban areas. Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin. Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River. Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling. The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems. Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network. a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use. b. Dashboard may show the following options i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc. ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days. 2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system. 3. DSS-based post-project monitoring to validate the benefit of government investments.",

This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out plans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources. 2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP├ö├ç├ûs core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people├ö├ç├ûs needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision. 3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance. The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. 4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas. Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9 broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot level through Panchayats adopting ├ö├ç├┐Whole of Government and Whole of Society Approach├ö├ç├û and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve localization for SDGs in rural India. 29 Subjects defined in the Eleventh Schedule 1.

Non-Conventional energy Description Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ├ö├ç├┐Farmville├ö├ç├û kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input. Key Components to include for the game app: Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning. Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc. The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: - i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers. ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required. iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village. iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc. v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats. vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features. vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed. viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform. ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.

Based on changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated. ├ö├ç├│ Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated. ├ö├ç├│ Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders. Case 2: Streetlight ├ö├ç├│ The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts. ├ö├ç├│ The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change ├ö├ç├┤ the changes to reflect on the game for best results. ├ö├ç├│ Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated. Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side. ├ö├ç├│ The player selects the village for developmental activity. ├ö├ç├│ The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village. ├ö├ç├│ The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area.

          "description": "BACKGROUND: In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network. Problem Statement Details: ├ö├ç┬úDevelop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.├ö├ç├ÿ NOTE : GAIL (INDIA) LTD will not provide any hardware, software, license, data or any other resource to SIH hackathon Teams.

This process involves verification of numerous documents such as birth certificates, academic transcripts, identification cards, and experience certificates. There is a pressing need for an online solution that automates and secures the document verification process. Description: This problem statement addresses the urgent requirement for an online platform, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, to automate document verification for all official purposes. The proposed solution aims to establish a user-friendly portal accessible to issuing authorities (e.g., schools, universities, employers), verifying authorities (government offices, banks, legal entities), and individuals. Issuing authorities will generate digital certificates for individuals, including birth certificates, academic transcripts, and experience certificates. These certificates will be securely stored on the blockchain for tamper-proof authenticity. Individuals will have access to the portal to view all documents issued in their name.

Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun├ö├ç├ûs trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and SimulinkÔö¼┬½, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using SimulinkÔö¼┬½ Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.

SAR image colorization using Deep Learning (DL) models offers a transformative approach for enhancing the interpretability of monochromatic SAR image data. The project aims to develop an innovative solution to colorize grayscale SAR images for enhanced interpretation and analysis of feature targets. A novel DL model needs to be designed and trained using pairs of SAR and Optical images, minimizing a loss function that captures the difference between predicted and actual color images. The participants are challenged to create a DL system that can accurately predict and apply colors to SAR images, making surface features more distinguishable and interpretable. Challenge: The challenges require innovative approaches in data pre-processing, DL model design, and evaluation methodologies to develop effective and reliable SAR image colorization solutions. Usage: The goal is to improve the usability of SAR data in applications like geological studies and environmental monitoring by providing more intuitive and informative visual representations. Users: Remote Sensing Image Analysts Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Existing Deep Learning models have been proposed and used but their performance is not satisfactory.

          "description": "Background: ODD School Structure refers to schools that do not conform to the standard categories defined by the Ministry of Education under the UDISE+ portal. These standard categories are designed to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity and consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside these categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having \"\"odd structures.\"\" However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the \"\"odd\"\" school structure category due to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the uniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This misalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala, where the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories. Description: The problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources, effective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd structures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with standardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some states, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives. The objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the defined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and effectiveness of educational policies across the country. Innovative Solutions: A. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze school data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify them as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to align schools with the standard categories. B. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best practices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures. The platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade reconfiguration, and community engagement strategies. C. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible resource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in distributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of schools with odd structures during the transition period. D. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring the progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This dashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them to track changes, identify bottlenecks, and intervene as necessary. E. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with school administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include forums, feedback tools, and support resources to facilitate the transition to standard structures, ensuring that the process is inclusive and addresses local concerns.",

          "description": "Background: Fuzzing is an automated process of identifying software vulnerabilities by supplying unexpected and faulty inputs to the software. The main aim of fuzzing is to identify the crucial edge cases where a software might fail. Therefore, fuzzing provides a crucial insight into the stability and security of the software. The process of fuzzing can be divided into following broad steps ├ö├ç├┤ 1. Identification of Target Function(s) ├ö├ç├┤ Target function(s) are typically those functions that act as entry points for processing input data. They use various APIs to perform operation on the input data. 2. Developing harness ├ö├ç├┤ Harnesses are small code stubs whose sole purpose is to invoke the target function by using mutated data inputs. A harness bridges the gap between how the fuzzer generates input and how the target application receives and processes the input. 3. Fuzzing - In this step, a fuzzer is used to generate numerous data inputs which are then passed to the target function using the harness. The fuzzer checks whether the application crashes by processing a certain input. If a crash occurs, then it saves the input and the memory state of the crash to file for later analysis. Description: Fuzzing has proven its effectiveness in discovering thousands of vulnerabilities in file-processing and stateless applications. In fuzzing, and automated testing in general, designing test oracles is crucial. In this challenge the team is supposed to fuzz an open source software namely the Windows variant of Sumatra PDF Reader software (version 3.5.2 or later). Sumatra PDF Reader is a very popular open source and widely used PDF viewing software. In this challenge, teams are required to develop a working harness for fuzzing of the latest version (version 3.5.2 or later) of Windows Sumatra PDF Reader software solution, fuzzed on any fuzzer of their choice. The submission will be evaluated on the following criteria ├ö├ç├┤ 1. Target functions identified 2. Live demonstration of fuzzing harness developed 3. Code Coverage achieved 4. Technical report submitted by the team. Expected Solution: Each team must provide a fuzzing harness that is capable of fuzzing the windows software solution of the Sumatra PDF Reader (version 3.5.2 or later). This fuzzing harness must identify target functions and supply appropriate arguments for the invocation of such functions. The fuzzing harness will be run using a fuzzer (preferably WinAFL). Each team must submit a working harness along with a technical report stating ├ö├ç├┤ 1. Reversing steps undertaken 2. Target functions identified 3. Dependencies identified",

          "description": "Background : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery. Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence. Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data. Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms. Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to: 1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs. 2. Support a wide range of file types: Recover Text-Based Document Formats(doc,docx, rtf, pdf, txt, odt, html, xml, ppt, odp, xls, ods, log, csv, tsv, txt, conf, ini, cfg etc), archives file(zip, tar, rar, iso, rpm, deb etc), Image-Based Document Formats(jpg, jpeg, png, gif, tif etc), executables binaries(.elf, .so, .a, exe, dll, bat, cmd) scripts files(ps, ps1, sh, bash, zsh, py etc), database file(.db etc) and other relevant data formats. 3. Extract complete metadata: Recover accurate creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, file names, and other essential metadata associated with deleted files. 4. Provide user-friendly interface: Offer an intuitive interface (GUI/CLI) for easily navigate recovered data and generate reports. 5. Ensure data integrity: Implement robust data validation and verification mechanisms to maintain the integrity of recovered data.",

Description: The RTN trucks, operating on various routes, touch intermediate points, where parcels and mail are off-loaded and loaded. The capacity utilization of the trucks fluctuates depending upon the volume of parcels/mail being carried by it [illustration: On the Ahmedabad-Ajmer-Jaipur route, Ahmedabad loads the truck up to 80% capacity for Ajmer. At Ajmer, 20 % of the volume is offloaded, and 30% loaded, bringing total loading to 90% capacity (80-20+30 = 90). Similarly, at Jaipur, 40% volume is offloaded and 50 % loaded, bringing total loading to 100% (90-40+50= 100)]. Real time data is required for optimal utilization of truck capacity and adequate planning. In order to monetize spare capacity, integration with 3PL partners for capacity sharing through API (as described in the previous point) is also required. RTN trucks traverse a fixed route with specific touch points. The trucks may be delayed due to various factors, such as vehicle breakdown, poor traffic conditions, detours, detention at one or more touch points etc. GPS, geofenced locking should be enabled for any detours or delays so that alerts may immediately be triggered for verification and corrective action in time. Live tracking of trucks, with points of delay is required for efficient and timely movement of parcels and mail in the value chain. There should be a system for dispatch and schedule management as per live data automatically populated and analyzed in real time. Any changes or deviations should automatically flow into the system so that schedules, which are downstream, automatically get updated and adjusted to the delay in real time. All data should be captured and populated automatically, and relevant MIS reports generated automatically with visualization where relevant. Expected Solution: As described above the expected solution is based of GPS leading to a strong GIS for the network for it to send alerts and prompt necessary adjustments on the interlinked parts of the supply chain for every run of the truck.",

          "description": "Background: Department of Posts (DoP) covers around 219 countries where a large diaspora of India in different economic capacities exists. PIOs still take/use Indian Products such as Puja Samagri/Traditional Attires/ Handicrafts. Most of them are dependent on e-commerce platform. Through this they cannot be assured of the quality of the products they get and transportation cost may also be very high. Secondly local sellers/small handicrafts artisans who are the actual manufacturers are not able to ship high quality products because of limited resources and information at their disposal. Hence there is a need to connect the Indian Community abroad with the local artisans. Description: In order to overcome this issue an application is required through which one can go to a particular local seller as per their preference and should be able to onboard the seller as well. The following data points may be required to be integrated in the said Application. 1. Global Indian Diaspora Data on the basis of their needs namely ├ö├ç├┤ Income/ Financial data, Consumption pattern and buying behavior pattern. 2. There should be Buyer and Seller Registration so that Quality Assurance and standard Transit Cost can be ensured. 3. Product and customer segments identification of target population, this includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) so that specific needs can be assessed like Puja Samagri of Kumartuli, Handicrafts of Santiniketan, Moya of Joynagar (famous sweets), Terracotta Arts of Bishnupur, etc. 4. Special preference should be given on keeping in the mind of Seasonal needs, Traditional Attires for Wedding ceremony, Festival needs as this varies geographically depending upon Special Socio Economic Culture. 5. A range of products which are prepared (by MSME and others ) in the different parts of India , which can match the buying needs of global diaspora. So that a global link through Postal Export may be created towards fulfillment of needs. Therefore, it is about bringing the Diaspora close to India and remains emotionally connected to their roots.",

          "description": "Background: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a) to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times. Description: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.",

Similarly, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher and higher number of Senior Citizen Social Security (SCSS) accounts can be opened for their benefit to justify presence of post offices in these areas. But there is no such report from where it can be identified, where and when the need of which product is higher. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Postal Life Insurance (PLI) , Rural Postal Life Insurance ( RPLI) have been arranged in villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child and senior citizens resulting in moderate to mediocre success for the efforts. Description: The Department of Posts has implemented various POSB Schemes in All over India uniformly. Actual demographic location-wise population is to be identified. In West Bengal, for example, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher. In some sectors demand young generation and service holders are much higher. The need of the youth and service holders are very different from the demands of other sector of people. Density of farmers and business-oriented people are higher in some areas. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD) PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. Expected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified. The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking & insurance) services.",

          "description": "Background: Due to fast and hectic lifestyle, in modern era, GenZ often desires to get more customised, time bound doorstep service for their opted products or services. E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department├ö├ç├ûs common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. Description: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery. This creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation. Expected Solution: - At time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery. Whenever recipient will receive sms/alert about the consignment to be delivered at his/her end with the mentioned time slot, the recipient should have the option/flexibility to make change of time slot online before the day of delivery. Initially such data will create training data for AI which will develop a reference frame of time slot for sender and also for delivery person of department for timely and customer friendly future delivery of article for same recipient. Last mile of delivery information will become integral part of booking which will help both consignment movement across the country and effective delivery.",

          "description": "Background: One of the primary concerns for philatelists in our country is the limited access to philatelic material released nationwide. Currently, each postal circle releases its own material, catering primarily to philatelists within its respective jurisdiction and immediate reach. Consequently, philatelists from other circles often find it challenging to obtain such material. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness regarding ancillary releases among the philatelic community nationwide. Description: To address these issues, the development of a comprehensive website dedicated to philately, which would serve as a centralized platform for philatelists across India is the prospective solution suggested. This website would facilitate the creation of a National Philately Deposit Account, enabling philatelists to access philatelic material released pan India. Other supporting mechanisms to strengthen the community can also be thought of and integrated to the main solution. Expected Solution: The proposed website would offer the following features: Centralized Platform: The website would display philatelic material released by all postal circles across India, ensuring that philatelists have access to a wide range of items. Online Ordering and Payment: Philatelists would be able to order and pay for philatelic material online through the website, streamlining the purchasing process and eliminating geographical barriers. Standard Postal Services: Postage for ordered items would be charged at the standard rates for Registered/ Speedpost services, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery. Cancellation Releases: Information regarding cancellation releases would be made available on the website, allowing philatelists to obtain cancellations on postal stationery through the website. Rates for such services can be determined accordingly.",

NSG operates on modus operandi of Small Team Operations, with the House Intervention Team (HIT) being the smallest combat unit. 2. In any CQB scenario, the NSG Task Force operates down to a HIT level with the Task Force Commander situated at the Integrated Command Post (ICP), with an aim to get real time location of the soldiers and a better tactical picture of the ongoing operations. The HITs mostly operate in built up areas (for example in Hotels, Hospitals, Metro stations, Buildings of National importance, etc) consisting of multiple floors and basements. Every soldier operates with the advanced military gear and radio communication utilized for conveying operational decisions. In such a setup, knowing the exact location of the soldier down to the floor/ basement is of paramount importance. 3. Traditional GPS/ GSM based solutions give the location on a 2D scale with no information regarding the floor at which the soldier is operating. Getting down to the floor level requires the installation of hardware on the floor for tracking the soldiers with the help of RFID or utilization of altimeter, accelerometer carried by the soldier. 4. Live location tracking in urban built up areas for CQB operations, addressing the following problems. (a) Location Tracking of HITs. Live tracking of HITs so that the Commander is able to track HITs operating on multiple floors/ basements. This helps in efficient command and control and thus enabling early success in the operations. (b) 3D Model. NSG keeps a database of 3D models of buildings which are potential targets for terror attacks. The 3D models of the buildings exist in the industry standard format. It is required that the resultant live location of the HITs (obtained through these trackers) be displayed on the pre-existing 3D models of the buildings.",

Since the operations are of National security significance, better understanding of the target layout is of paramount importance. 3-Dimensional walk through of the buildings helps in the efficient understanding of the target layout and also enables effective briefing of the troops by the Commander for operating inside such targets. 2. Presently, the building authorities provide 2-Dimensional layout of the building in the form of blue prints/ floor plan. Assimilation of the situation and appreciating the potent threat with the help of 2-Dimensional layout turns out to be a challenging task. In such a scenario, a 3-Dimensional walk-through of the building helps significantly in increasing the efficiency of the ground forces while operating. 3. The software which needs to be developed should take the 2-Dimensional blueprint layout as input and also should take various parameters like length, breadth, height of the building, layout of staircase, entry and exit, etc as additional inputs. The software should then export them to a file and create a full fledged 3-Dimensional walkthrough model of the building. The software must also include the facility for integration of exported model to the offline Google maps, Satellite pictures (if any available). 4. Since the target includes buildings which are secretive in nature, the software is required to be operable fully in standalone mode, without any internet connectivity required in future. For the initial installation phase, the system can be connected to the internet to facilitate fetching up of Maps, satellite imagery from open source, etc required for the software functioning. 5. This software would also reduce the time taken during the initial briefing of the troops prior to the launch of any operation. It further increases the efficiency of the operations, thus resulting in early success. 6. The conversion of 2-Dimensional blueprints to 3-Dimensional models must address following problems. (a) Software should take 2-Dimensional blueprint as an input and produce 3- Dimensional walk through as output. (b) Provisions to input parameters like length, breadth, height of the building and other details should be included.

          "description": "Background: Press Registrar General of India (PRGI) maintains a database containing approximately 160,000 titles. When a user submits a new title for verification, we need to check its similarity against the existing titles in our database. The goal is to ensure that the new title does not duplicate or closely resemble any existing title to avoid confusion and maintain uniqueness. Additionally, the system must enforce specific guidelines to ensure that certain words are not used, combinations of existing titles are not allowed, and titles with similar meanings or periodicity modifications are rejected. Problem Description Develop a system to automatically verify new title submissions by checking for similarities with existing titles in the database and ensuring compliance with specific guidelines. The system should reject titles that are too similar to existing ones, contain disallowed words, or violate other outlined rules. Additionally, the system should provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. Requirements: 1. Similarity Check: a. Implement a mechanism to check for similar-sounding names using phonetic similarity algorithms (e.g., Soundex, Metaphone). b. Identify titles that have common prefixes or suffixes (e.g., The, India, Samachar, News). c. Ensure that variations in spelling or slight modifications do not bypass the similarity check (e.g., Namaskar vs. Namascar). d. Calculate a similarity percentage for each title comparison. 2. Prefix/Suffix Handling: a. Maintain a list of disallowed prefixes and suffixes. b. Reject any new titles that include these disallowed prefixes or suffixes if they cause the new title to resemble an existing title closely. 3. Guideline Enforcement: a. Maintain a list of disallowed words (e.g., Police, Crime, Corruption, CBI, CID, Army). b. Ensure that titles containing these disallowed words are rejected. c. Prevent the creation of new titles by combining existing ones (e.g., if \"Hindu\" and \"Indian Express\" exist, \"Hindu Indian Express is not allowed\"). d. Check for titles with similar meanings in other languages and reject them (e.g., \"Daily Evening\" and \"Pratidin Sandhya\"). e. Disallow adding periodicity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to existing titles to form new ones. 4. Verification Probability: a. Provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. 5. Database Interaction: a. Efficiently search and compare new titles against the database of 160,000 titles. b. Track current applications and use them for future reference to reject similar titles submitted later. c. Use indexing and optimised search techniques to handle the large dataset and ensure quick responses. 6. User Feedback: a. Provide clear feedback to the user if their submitted title is too similar to an existing title, contains disallowed prefixes/suffixes, violates guidelines, or is created by combining existing titles. b. Display the verification probability to the user. c. Allow the user to modify their title and resubmit it for verification. 7. Scalability: a. Design the system to handle an increasing number of titles and user submissions. b. Ensure that the system remains performant as the database grows. Expected Solution: 1. The system will provide the probability of a title being verified. For instance, if a title has a similarity score of 80%, the verification probability shall not be more than 100%-80%=20% 2. The system will reject any new title that is too similar to existing ones, contains disallowed words or prefixes/suffixes, combines existing titles, or has similar meanings in other languages. 3. The system will track current applications and use them for future reference, rejecting similar titles submitted later by other users. Acceptance Criteria: 1. Accuracy: a. The system correctly identifies similar-sounding titles and provides consistent results. b. The system accurately rejects titles with disallowed prefixes, suffixes, and words. c. The system prevents the creation of titles by combining existing titles and identifies titles with similar meanings in other languages. d. The system disallows adding periodicity to existing titles. e. The system provides an accurate verification probability score. 2. Performance: a. Title verification is completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds per title). b.
